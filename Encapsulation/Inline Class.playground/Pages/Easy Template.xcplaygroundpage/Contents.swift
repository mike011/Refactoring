// Refactor the following by using: `Inline Class`

// 1. In the target class, create functions for all the public functions of the source class. These functions should just delegate to the source class.
// 2. Change all references to source class methods so they use the target classâ€™s delegators instead. Test after each change.
// 3. Move all the functions and data from the source class into the target, testing after each move, until the source class is empty.
// 4. Delete the source class and hold a short, simple funeral service.
